# MNIST Classification Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels.
